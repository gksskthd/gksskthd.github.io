        <h1>Filaroid</h1><br>
            <h2>UX Design</h2>
            <p>When ‘Filaroid’ reached out to me, they are planning to develop second version of their mobile application and launch in US. So, I had a chance to think deeply the most of the problem that start-up companies have. We all know there are so many new services emerge and disappear even they are providing good service. Why? To put it shortly what I found is, they fail to link design including UX, branding and ad designs with their business model.<br><br>So, these are what I consult them:</p>
        <div class="images">
     <img src="img/filaroid/FIlaroid_Wireframe.jpg" max-width="800" height="auto">
            </div>
    <h3>1.Make your goal visible </h3>
    <p>1 million apps on Google PlayStore and 1.8 million apps on App Store, however we know only a few. (Statista) The reason is the companies do not think through the feasibility of what they want to achieve and how. The ‘Filaroid’’s main profit is coming from the coupon; they are selling the coupon like as the actual film, but it is so hard to find where/how the user purchase it. So, I worked with wireframe and suggested to bring ‘Purchase coupon’ to main and payment page.</p>

                </div>
           <h3>2. Understand user behavior</h3>
    <p>The team want to create the user experience resemble to the film camera. They designed the function that required ‘slide’ movement to left for ‘saving’ and right for ‘retake’. However I found out this movement against the natural gesture (usually, we are comfortable to slide left to right for making decision and vice versa.) and making inconvenience. We often forgot how we trained in digital world. But if the user have several unpleasant miscommunication with your design, the user easily move to other service.</p>

                </div>
               <h3>3. Show your advantage in the forefront. </h3>
    <p>By going through the user interview, I found more than half of the user prefer to use the filter in their camera application. However, even though ‘Filaroid’ puts a lot of effect to develop vintage filters and frames, both are hidden and most of the users have trouble to find those functions. I advised to guide people to explore the filter and frame more visually interesting and clear by adding random option. This would create the tone of the app fun and retro. <br>The ‘Filaroid’ team and I worked together updating the wireframe and final design. Once we finalized revision, we gone through few user testing and correct the language. These updates have impact on profit and get 22% of new users compare to previous version. </p>
